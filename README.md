# SharokinChess
SharokinChess, a C++ chess application with a user-friendly GUI, single and two players feature, custom board setup, game history navigation, and more.

# A Brief History
I developed the myBoard.cpp,h and think.cpp,h files, originally in 2003, as the back-end/engine of a desktop chess game project in
**Royagaran Narmafzar Co.**. The game was commissioned by the **Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults** (کانون پرورش فکری کودکان و نوجوانان)
and was published on CDs and delivered to the market in Iran.

In development of the back-end/engine, I was strongly interested and focused on algorithms, I was new to C++ and used early versions of it combined with C.

In 2005, as a lighter graphical interface for test purposes, I created a GUI application under lovely **Borland C++ Builder** for private use only.
The present repository contains an equivalent GUI application ported to **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community**,
with some improvements in the interface, some refactoring and bug-fixes in the back-end/engine toward more modern and maintainable C++ code.

The project is ongoing and I'm hoping to adopt modern C++ practices, enhance readability and maintainability and fix potential bugs.
